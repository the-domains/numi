            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>'Light field' camera maker Lytro announces professional VR video rig</h1><p>Camera maker Lytro drew our attention three years ago with what it called "light field" photography. Instead of focusing at a specific depth, its camera would capture everything in range of its finder, so you could do things like pick a focus after taking the picture.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/656906e37edfa8831a9d2951c445a7cf45513621.jpg"></article>]]></description>
